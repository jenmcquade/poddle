# poddle
A WordPress Plugin for Friendlier Podcast Websites

---

Poddle is a WordPress plugin created with the intention of increasing Podcast and Website visitor engagement and retention, by implementing a set of content-driven components from industry Podcast APIs.

The word “poddle” is a British English word meaning “to move or travel in a leisurely manner”.

The Poddle plugin adopts this same free-spirited behavior by enhancing a Podcast brand’s WordPress user interactions beyond the basic functionality of other WordPress plugins and themes, such as frontend audio/video players, Podcast subscriber links, or comments that are only visible on the WordPress platform.

By incorporating more exploratory and interactive features into a brand’s online presence, Poddle is designed to nurture a more direct relationship between Podcast hosts and their audience.
