# poddle
A WordPress Plugin for Friendlier Podcast Websites

---

Poddle is a WordPress plugin created with the intention of increasing Podcast and Website visitor engagement and retention, by implementing a set of content-driven components from industry Podcast APIs.

The word “poddle” is a British English word meaning “to move or travel in a leisurely manner”.

The Poddle plugin adopts this same free-spirited behavior by enhancing a Podcast brand’s WordPress user interactions beyond the basic functionality of other Podcast plugins.

As such, Poddle does not include features like RSS importing, frontend audio/video players, or Podcast subscriber links. Instead, Poddle is your Podcast's go-to plugin for secondary content, such as user-generated reviews and episode playlists.

By incorporating more exploratory and interactive features into your Podcast brand’s online presence, Poddle is designed to nurture a more direct relationship between you and your audience.
